This Interactive Quiz Application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of an internship project with CodTech. The application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback on their selections, and track their score in real-time. Questions are dynamically loaded, and the interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly. At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their final score along with a message indicating that a completion certificate will be issued on the internship end date. This project showcases the practical application of JavaScript in creating dynamic, interactive web experiences and fulfills the internship requirement of delivering a polished quiz app with scoring and question management features.
